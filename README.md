# synth-lab
Created with CodeSandbox.

This is a react.js visual interface to a basic tone.js synthesizer. You can grow or shrink the keyboard by octaves, and change the root octave, which defaults to a middle C. You can control the attack and release of the notes, selecting between an eighth, quarter, half, or whole note. It can also record the notes you play and play them back for you.

## TODO

- Give more control over synthesizer parameters in the interface
- Fix the playback (it doesn't quite use the right rhythm, though it seems close enough with quarter notes) 
- Visualize the notes on an sctual score, instead of in text
- Enable a MIDI interface
